    # Fun with Weather! Detailed weather app in Python!!
    #### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdbCQ6CrgBM <URL HERE>
    #### Description:
    Enter the city name, then enter the more detailed location and voila! all the deatils of the weather are there. The end of clunky weather apps!!
    I have used the "OpenWeather API" for fetching the weather data. The main code is divided into 4 parts, main, city, make_url and export. The main function lays the blueprint for the working of the main function. So here is the outline:
    1. The 'main' function takes in an input for city in the form of 'z' and then stores it as a variable.
    2. then, the city function takes in a more detailed area and then returns it in the form of 'z'
    3. the 'make_url' function joins the city (z) into a pre-determined url through an "f string", proceeds to store it in the 'ip' variable
    Then the url is printed onto the screen after which the requests.get() function retrieves all the data from the url. If the URL passes the specified checks and returns the HTTP code of '200'. If '200' is not recieved then the program exits, then through .json() the data is stored on the computer for python to interpret. Then through the data function from main, the temperature is retrieved. But, it is in kelvin, so we subtract 273 from the degree kelvin reading to get the celcius readings, then the reading is rounded to provide a better user experience. Then the description from the weather is retrieved. the description is stored in the 'desc' variable. After that the visibility is seen. We can retrieve it in a similiar method, but since visibility is the only clause in the visibility section, we dont need the declare any other parameter. In the same way the coordinates are retrieved. After that, all the different things are printed on the screen. Through the export function. Finall the main() is called for execution of the entire thing.
